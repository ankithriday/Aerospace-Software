3. The first ten characters imply the file type (first character), and the permissions (last nine characters). The permissions are given in groups of three for the owner, the group, and the world. For example, r means that user has permission to read the file, while w means the user has permission to write to the file.

4. du -h

5. cp: Copies a file into a set directory.
cat: conCATenates a files contents to the output. Can be used to display contents of a file or to write/append to a file.
pwd: Prints the name of the Working Directory to the screen.
mkdir: Creates a directory with a set name in a given directory.
kill: Send processes signals by their PID. This sends the TERM signal which terminates the program.

6. 
- To create folder: mkdir ASEN4519
- First change to ASEN4519 directory: cd ASEN4519
  Then create .txt file: touch asen4519test.txt
- Used vim to edit text file.
- Change user permissions: chmod 755 asen4519test.txt
- Show all contents of ~/Documents/ASEN4519: ls -a -l

- Start MATLAB: matlab #
- Asses process expenses: top
  MATLAB is using 0.3% CPU and 15.1% Memory
- It took 8.930854s to run line, and during it used: 99.0% CPU and 55.3% Memory
  Once done, MATLAB is now utilizing: 0.3% CPU and 73.7% Memory
- Run MATLAB as bg process w/ -15 nice value: sudo nice --15 matlab &
  It took 8.843513s to run line this time with a -15 nice level. This little bit shorter time is what we would expect because it took less time to run the program when the nice priority was set to be more urgent (more negative/higher priority). However, this small time difference could be indicative of the fact that the CPU percentage was already at its maximum possible value for a nice setting of 0 (it was at 99%), and therefore this nice setting change did not actually affect the performance speed of MATLAB.

8. The actual executable for MATLAB is located in the directory /usr/local/bin and you can start it from the command line without the full path name because it uses symbolic links, which use a symbolic variable that references the full pathname/directory path that the machine needs in order to execute the program.

9. The bash shell searches the bin of executable bash script programs to run different commands on our VM. That info is stored in the bin/ directory. Yes you can change the location where the bash shell searches for programs.

10. ls /bin | sort | ls /usr/bin | sort > ~/Documents/usefulprograms.txt

11. Default terminal for VM is xterm. This is set in the /etc/environment directory.

12. To change the default text editor (which was originally gedit), first we opened the "Files" GUI app and right clicked on a .txt file, then clicked properties. Next we went to the "Open With" tab and selected Vim and clicked the "Set as default" button. This changed the default editor to Vim.
